# Query-Closing-on-Stack-Overflow
Developing classifiers to predict whether a user query will be closed or not.

Stack Overflow (SO) is a website specifically designed to help the users get answers to the programming
related questions posted by them. As the number of questions is increasing everyday, it is very important for the SO community to
maintain the quality of the questions in order to serve the users with quality content. And hence questions found to be of low
quality as per the community guidelines are closed. The process of closing questions is not completely automated and hence it is a
tedious task for the moderators. This work proposes a classifier to automate the process of closing questions on SO and to let
the user know that the posted question has high probability to get closed. 

We have developed machine learning classifiers for predicting whether a user query on SO will be closed or not and if closed, its reason for closure.
